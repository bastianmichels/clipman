== Manual steps (need a human)
  1. Press Super+V, pick a clip, and confirm it pastes into the focused app.
  2. Turn incognito on in the popup, copy some text, and confirm no new
     entry appears in the history. Turn incognito off; copies work again.
  3. Run: gnome-extensions disable clipman@clipman.com
     Open the popup with `clipman toggle` and confirm it now shows in
     Alt+Tab (GNOME 49+ only). Re-enable the extension afterwards.
  4. Check the journal for "clipman: denied" lines from this script:
     journalctl --user -b -g "clipman: denied" | tail
