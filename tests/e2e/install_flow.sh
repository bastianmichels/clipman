# End to end in a headless GNOME Shell, the way a user meets Clipman:
#
#   login 1  run install.sh while the Shell is running (#1: the extension
#            was never enabled); until the next login nothing can record
#            copies, and the daemon says so instead of starting
#            wl-paste --watch, which GNOME cannot run; the first
#            `clipman toggle` (the shortcut) starts the daemon and opens
#            the popup, and the next one closes it
#   login 2  the extension is on, the daemon starts, a copy is recorded,
#            scripts/extension-smoke.sh passes, a huge copy and an app
#            that never sends its data cost the Shell little, the open
#            popup does not spin a CPU core (#307), and uninstall.sh
#            stops a daemon started by hand and keeps the data without a
#            terminal (#328)
#
# Usage: tests/e2e/install_flow.sh [workdir]
# Needs gnome-shell, python3 with GTK 4 and libadwaita, dbus and
# wl-clipboard. Nothing reaches the user's own session: see
# headless-shell.sh.

# No pipefail: `producer | grep -q` would then fail whenever grep stops
# reading early. Each check tests its own result.
